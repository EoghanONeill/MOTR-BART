## Introduction
\begin{itemize}

 \item The Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) is the monetary authority that regulates the financial industry in the country;
 \vspace{0.15cm}
 \item After consolidating, the CBB becomes available part of the data received from the banks (public and private);
  \vspace{0.15cm}
 \item Data about economy activity, monetary indicators, financial market indicators, delinquency rates by product, \textbf{credit indicators}, etc;
  \vspace{0.15cm}
 \item Why analysing this information?
 
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item In 2018, the average interest rate for revolving products (e.g. credit card and overdraft) was more than $350\%$ per year;
     \item In Ireland, it was around $9\%$; UK, $6\%$.
 \end{enumerate} 
 
\end{itemize}

## Introduction

 In this package, I considered only the monthly data of the following \textbf{credit indicators}:
 
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Allowance}: provision in relation to the loan portfolio of the National Financial System (NFS);
   \vspace{0.15cm}
   \item \textbf{Spread}: the difference between the interest rate that bank charges the borrower when lending money minus the interest rate payed to the depositor;
   \vspace{0.15cm}
   \item \textbf{Household debt}: represents the sum of all debts (loans, mortgage, credit cards, overdraft utilisation, etc) over the sum of incomes for all clients in the NFS;
   \vspace{0.15cm}
   \item \textbf{Interest rate}: average interest rate of new credit operations.

\end{enumerate}

## Functions of the packages CredInd

The package `CredInd` has 3 functions that

\begin{itemize}
\item Read/manipulate (\textbf{ReadData}) the data;
\end{itemize}
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data1 <- ReadData(Indicator='Interest rate',
                  Index='Total')
```
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\item Fit ARIMA models (\textbf{FitModels}); and
\end{itemize}
```{r, eval=FALSE}
model <- FitModels(data = data1, horizon=20)
```
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\item Generate a plot (\textbf{plot\_FitModels}) for the selected credit indicator.
\end{itemize}
```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_FitModels(model)
```

## Functions of the packages CredInd
When Indicator equals to 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ReadData(Indicator='Interest rate', Index='Total')
```
\begin{itemize}
 \vspace{-0.35cm}
\item \textbf{Allowance}, the parameter Index can be Total, Public banks, National private control, Foreign control and Private control;
 \vspace{0.25cm}
\item \textbf{Spread} and \textbf{Interest rate}, Index can be Total, New operations companies, New operations households, Non-revolving total, Non-revolving companies and Non-revolving households;
 \vspace{0.25cm}
\item \textbf{Household debt}, Index can be Total and Without mortgage.
\vspace{0.25cm}
\end{itemize}

## Example
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data1 <- ReadData(Indicator = 'Interest rate',
                  Index = 'Total')
model1 <- FitModels(data = data1, horizon=20)
plot_FitModels(model1)
```
- Best model: ARIMA$(p=1,d=1,q=3)$, where $p$ is the AR order, $d$ is the degree of differencing and $m$ is the MA order;
- Correlation: $98\%$.

## Example

## Example
```{r, eval=FALSE}
data2 <- ReadData(Indicator = 'Spread',
                  Index = 'New operations households')
model2 <- FitModels(data = data2, horizon=20)
plot_FitModels(model2)
```
- Best model: ARIMA$(p=1,d=1,q=1)$, where $p$ is the AR order, $d$ is the degree of differencing and $m$ is the MA order;
- Correlation: $97\%$.
